                            increasingly important role in peopleâ€˜s lives, which
                            makes people pay more attention to the health of
                            dogs. The primary problem is the challenge in effectively
                            predicting and managing health issues in dogs. This
                            includes early detection of diseases and
                            understanding breed-specific vulnerabilities.</p>
